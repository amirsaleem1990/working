Here are some of points about #MachineLearning: 1. Machine Learning means learning from Data. 2. Machine = Your machine/computer Learning = Finding patterns from data 3. Machine Learning is just Data + Algorithms, but Data is more important. 4. Feature extraction is key. If total prediction power is 100% then the effort of feature engineering = 80% and the effort of the learning algorithm = 20%. 4. Overfitting is when your algorithm is memorizing instead of learning. 5. If you have small amounts of data then you‚Äôre better off using more simple models (linear&logistic regression). If you have large amounts of data you can try out more complex models (Deep Learning, etc.) 6. To avoid overfitting, always use regularization 7. Training is the most important part of Machine Learning.  8. Choose your features and hyper parameters carefully. 9. Machines don‚Äôt take decisions, people do. 10. Data cleaning is the most important part of Machine Learning. You know the saying: Garbage in Garbage out.

Are you working on an AI/ DS/ ML/ CV related project at your workplace, a research lab, or via freelance in Pakistan or abroad? (Focus is on Pakistan but your experience in companies abroad helps) If so, please volunteer for all or some of the following questions.  - What is your institution name? - Which domain in specific are you working on? Such as computer vision etc.  - What sort of questions does your company focus on at interviews? For instance some companies are known for heavy stats based questions for data analytics interviews from a book called Statistics with R. Would appreciate your depth in this. Others just focus on tools and no clear depth on concept. This question helps us in understanding the company.  - What language, tools are used at your institution if you are willing to answer.  - Does your company hire freshies (with some projects experience)?  - Does your company conduct a test? - What is the median salary at your workplace? You can choose to not answer this. - An insight if any, you would like to share for someone trying to enter this industry.  Edit: What are the one or two things your company looks for in a candidate in terms of experience? Atleast some software development background? Some self made projects? Their degrees? (I will be collecting these in a anon survey later on, with a few more questions and a form will be released. For now, share with us about your company! Will help me out in some questions by freshies)

"Health Care is one of the most important fields AI gonna transform"Sundar Pichai - CEO ALPHABETAs, I said last year in a post that I will be starting a series of projects for AI in health care to show and inspire developer community to develop AI for Good. Asia is lacking far behind in health care as compared to other developed countries. But now everyone has the power of changing that using AI. AI can be the best assistant of doctors in enormous cases, from helping them automate several scans and also giving best recommendations to patients. The scope of AI in health care is not just limited to doctors. It can also empower biologists and chemists to create more effective drugs or medicine based on specific type of disease. It can also lead us to try molecular level programming that will one day be a part of us saving us from different epidemics.I will be creating the projects series that will use Machine learning and Deep learning to find the best solution of different problems in health care. The project series will be open source and will be available on github. It has 2 parts:-1. Creation of models in python along with their weights .h5 file.2. Creation of Web API's and android applications from that models to show the world and get a business out of it.

So much of the study I did assumed I had data. Well, now I don't and I can't seem to find a guide on how to label images like these so excuse this basic question.How do I label these cracks? Should I use lines or the brush tool? Do I tag them as cracks afterward? What I have seen done is that a different class of objects is made like kiwi and lemons. Do I make a class for cracks and road? Many thanks. *The end goal is segmentation.

Use this One Weird Trick to make your Python code blindingly fast: from numba import jit @jit def loops():         a = 0         for i in range(1000):                 for j in range(1000):                         for k in range(1000):                                 a += i * j * k         return a  print(loops()) What to watch for: 1. If there's a Numpy function that already does what you want, use that. 2. Numba covers most of native Python and Numpy functions, but not 100%. 3. jit-ted code is a bit trickier to debug, so save @jit for decorating your processing bottlenecks.

Had fun moderating a panel at GDG Kolachi's event yesterday- #ChaiAndAI over the state and future of AI Industry in Pakistan with the panelists who are some of the leading experts in this Industry. Hussain Mehmood from MarketLytics, Zia Saleem from Integration Experts, and Noman Khalid from LFD.  The conclusion of the panel talk: We identified a few challenges that the Industry faces i.e High demand of resources but less supply of quality resources, aversity to enter this Industry from potential clients, lack of proper data due to not a proper infrastructure etc. The panelists shared how they have gone above and beyond to fix the challenges above by training people for supply and demand side, by spending a decent amount of time with clients to help them not only believe how data centered processes can increase their efficiacy but also adjusting to their environments to deliver the solution the client wants.  A lot of different industries approach AI/ML companies just because their counterpart industries did something similar, without knowing why they need it. But the AI/Ml companies bear a huge responsibility educating such industries and helping them derive a solution that offers efficiency above cost- and sales matter. One crucial advice for people aspiring to enter this fiend was "Do not enter this field just because you think its the end of the world if you dont study anything AI/ ML related- do it because you like it." If you are that keen on learning, still identify your passion first- it could be psychology, marketing anything and then figure out how you can apply AI in this domain. Yes this field has been around for a long time but innovations has been more lately. As Zia Saleem quoted, "If you were interested in data science a few years back, you probably would have been doing a BBA," and Noman Khalid said, "Do a BBA" :P and yes finish what you have started, don't jump here and there- begin and finish. There are different learning tracks leading you to the same thing often, but pick one and go through entirely. Be consistent. And yes, as we say again and again and again- "YOU CANNOT BECOME A DATA SCIENTIST IN ONE MONTH, NOT EVEN IF UDACITY CLAIMS IT." Overall, we have some great people in the Industry trying to equip the generation for the 4th Industrial wave. There are challenges, it will take time, but these people understand the ins and out and are working tirelessly and will full believe to make things happen. There was a lot more to learn. If anybody else attended, please do quote. Lastly, there were still a lot of people confused between AI, ML, DS and the differences between all- if you are confused please take a lot at our announcements at the 'Pakistan.AI Bank'. We have maintained all this on our Github.  This last year I tried to focus on professional growth (as you know, I am a software engineer at Systems) but oh how much have I missed community work!!!!

Questions for the people from academia/research labs, if you know anyone who can helpful here please tag them. Would be preferred if people from pure research side answer this. There have been some work in R&D products in labs but my questions are not posed towards them. - What is the current of state of research in your institution/lab? What sub-fields of AI is your group focused on? What sort of problem are you currently working on? - What is the total size of your research group/team? And how many journal/conference papers your group has published? - Is your research group in collaboration with a foreign research institute/group? If yes, please mention the groups. - What sort of full time research opportunities are available there in your group for non faculty, non student aspiring researchers? - If someone who's currently in industry with around a couple of years expirience or someone who's doing research in a different area and wants to move into AI research, what opportunities are there for them? - What would be the average pay for a full-time researcher in your group, given they've done Bachelor's degree with some research exposure in FYP? If you prefer not to answer any of the above questions, just skip them, give as much info as you comfortably can. Thank you.

High accuracy pedestrian detection based on #RPN and #synthetic #dataset. The most exciting feature in RPN is anchor boxes. I used K-means clustering for anchor boxes generation because If the size of Anchor boxes is selected well, then it will be easier for the network to learn. The red dots in the anchor box position are positive samples (area of interest) and the black dots are negative samples that all belongs to background.

Maybe smart watches do have sensors to do it ?? If not, what could be a good way to measure the height ?Constraints while thinking about the solution :-Should be configured on Smartwatches that are avl in the market at a lower price.Need to work with existing devices, no additional hardwares to be added.P.S : Please share this post to people/groups who could help build such a thing.

How many Data Scientist does it take to change a bulb? Well, if we had 100 Data Scientists to do this task: - half of them would ignore the main problem and come up with different ways of creating light in the room - half of the rest would dive straight into arxiv.org, claiming a Wasserstein type of GAN, transferring knowledge from screws to bulbs, would probably get some practical results, hopefully - we‚Äôre down to 25 Data Scientists, and nobody has even seen the bulb yet - 12 would say the bulb is written in Python, and they are more an R person - 3 would say the real problem of the client is, that they don‚Äôt use LED panels, so what are you going to do about it? - 2 would refuse to work on this problem, since the number of bulbs prevents them from creating any meaningful statistical analysis - 2 would accidentally mislabel the data, and claim the problem is already solved - which leaves only 6 Data Scientists at this point - 5 of them would either forget to save their work, or to run the experiments log, or datasets journal, so their results wouldn‚Äôt be reproducible - and maybe 1 Data Scientist would finally change the bulb. Probably an intern. Credit: Lukasz Kuncewicz Head of Data Science at Enigma Pattern Inc

Word of Advice: So I have been conducting interviews for positions of Junior ML engineers and I have been observing people here claiming that 50K is a low pay for Data Scientists. So here is my 2 cents on the two topics: -Candidates come up claiming to know ML and DS, but they do not know how to handle null values. -Candidates are unable to distinguish between Deep Learning and Machine Learning (yes the two are different). -Just knowing how to build a model is not enough to get 50K+, you should know other skills, for e.g. linux, web services, NoSQL, etc. -Do not grade yourself too high on a skill you barely know, people have been giving themselve 4/5 on linux, but they barely know the command for copy or the switch to use when they need to know access rights. P.S: The above is a generalization of the candidates I have interviewed, there were some good ones too and we made them appropriate offers. So if you really want 50+ as a Data Scientist, make sure you know all of your stuff, not just neural networks.

Some thoughts for DS related people... Some months ago, I applied in some companies/software houses for DS related opportunities. I have Masters in Electronics degree from UoK, so, most of them even didn't bother to call me for an interview. So, recently, I was interviewing some candidates for SE related position. I came to interview a candidate from the same company where I had applied. First of all, I asked him what was his background. He told me that he is working as a Data Scientist at that company. I then asked him some questions related to DS, and to my astonishment, he miserably failed to answer even basic questions. He even didn't know why do we use a box plot, how SVM works, didn't know whether Logistic Regression was for classification or regression. So, my advice for companies working in DS domain is to remain up to the par with their hiring strategies. Keep it up! Keep idolizing institutes like IBA, LUMS, HU, FAST etc. Again keep it up!

Don't get trapped in the idea of "I know nothing compared to them". You could be a student, getting your PH.D, or even a Kaggle Expert. You may never have competed in a Kaggle competition. May never have "real industry" experience. Never worked on your first "real" dataset. Or never have used fancy tools like "Spark" or "Hadoop". And still feel like you're far behind from being a Data Scientist. The truth is: you'll never be "ready". There's always something new to learn and each new level of expertise requires a new way of thinking. Don't get disappointed and compare yourself to others. Instead, focus on learning and doing more.  We all have our own paths. All of us have done something great in the past and stories that we feel most proud of. And this is what you should be focusing on: your achievements. It's those small victories that will lead to your big wins. Just recently, I wrote my first ebook and built a website for people to learn data science. And I'm proud to say that it's one of the most rewarding experience to help people grow.  Your story doesn't need to be fancy. You don't have to change the world. It just needs to be important for yourself.  www.claoudml.com

‚ÄúMy contribution towards society‚Äù Generating Synthetic Antigens for COVID‚Äô19 / Deep Leaning  COVID‚Äô19 the new threat to the world, as you know that this new nCov is a global problem The outbreak started in China in late 2019 and by March 2020 the disease has spread to over 148 countries around the world.  I got inspired by Suraj Raval deep learning corona virus ü¶† competition Then I started working on this . The project began with the clone of Topazape repo but then the idea changed , instead of finding the best drug i started to generate the best fit antibodies still you can have a look at it : https://github.com/topazape/LSTM_Chem Purpose : To find the best possible way to cure / treat the virus this process it included algorithms that was obtained from the database of approximately 4 million known molecules and compounds to discover those with the most potential in treating COVID-19, as well as generate entirely new perfectly binding antibodies Generating a RNN model and applying transfer learning and Genetic algorithms to find the best match. It took around 4 days to fully train the baseline model i used NVIDIA CUDA GPU to train it i took help from Github repository it all started after cloning it, but then i changed it according to my research. A big shout out to all of them without them this wouldn‚Äôt be possible as i have 0% medical background! Final results : The Corona virus ü¶† is same like a crown with porcupine like spikes on its surface and when it enters your body it sticks to your protein building blocks . Once the vaccine delivers the genetic materials into your body cells the cells follow the instructions to fight that virus . Take it as a puzzle üß© or a  üîê you need an exact match to proceed further. An antibody is a large protein that recognises A small part of a foreign invader called the antigen , it can be anything from viruses, bacteria, fungi etc. While one end of the antibody binds to its antigen the other ends stick out and it changes the shape/structure of your protein block/molecule. PS: i am still on it need some more time and research to come to a final decision.

Asalamualikum everyone, I performed a trend analysis of #COVID19 in Pakistan. I completed this at the day end of 16 March 2020 because I did not find much covered in regards to Pakistan. As a relevant domain expert in analytics, I felt I should speak up. The video is made in Urdu to keep the general public informed and educated on the situation (in the hope they take the matter more seriously). If you are in agreement that this post deserves to be shared, please spread the word so that it reaches more people. The situation looks dangerous, please stay home and take it seriously.

Let me introduce you to a Neural Network which was discovered about 6 months ago in our exclusive lab, The Simula Jefferson National Laboratory. It is quite underrated as compared to what Cycle GANNs or Style GANNs got the hype among the deep learning researchers. However, our Neural Network is quite intelligent and a masterpiece. Far better than Sophia. Meet Hashir. Let‚Äôs call him hashu because it is cuter this way. I don‚Äôt know his official nickname though because this project is not directly under my supervision and I live quite faraway and whenever I get to meet its doctors/scientists (Dr. Sarosh and Dr. Fatima) via online link, we tend to emphasize more on monitoring its actions and notice the changes it has been evolved with over time, rather talking about silly things like official nickname. What‚Äôs extraordinary is this Neural Network is independent of the GPUs like GTX 960M or Google Colab, Kaggle or Amazon‚Äôs or the Lab‚Äôs self-owned powerful datacenters. It is self-sustainable and its computational power comes from a microprocessor, having size of about 15 cm called a brain. The scientists say we can‚Äôt measure its computational power in units like GPUs or TPUs because it is of very special kind. The more it is used, the more its computational power expands. This extraordinary, yet tiny microprocessor is connected with endless actuators, which helps in collecting this Neural Network its dataset, which it is later trained on. What‚Äôs remarkable, many of its actuators have endless degrees of freedom. Unlike other Neural Networks, it is not trained in few hours or days using AWS or GCP provided with few GBs of dataset. It is a forever evolving Neural Network which trains itself autonomously without human intervention and does all the data engineering and data cleaning parts by itself, without troubling the Dr. Sarosh and Dr. Fatima. It doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt require any monitoring at all. See I am yet talking about the Neural Network training process. Had I been talking about its testing and performance, I would certainly have mentioned Tesla here, which requires partial monitoring of human drivers for a car to keep driving autonomously. Hashu is kept under careful observations, where the scientist‚Äôs prime duty is to expose hashu to the right datasets and the rich datasets. What I mean is, if it stayed home, it won‚Äôt be able to recognize cats or dogs or sheep or elephants. Or it may so, if it notices the black cat that pays often visits to his house but scientists doubt that in future, it may result in causing overfitting and under fitting. Therefore, it is very necessary for doctors to expose hashu to the right variety of datasets. Overfitting in a sense that it may won‚Äôt be able to recognize a cat if by chance any other cat such as a white cat someday paid a visit to his house. Hashu won‚Äôt recognize it. Because it is just trained on a cat which is black. Therefore, to solve this challenging problem, the scientists take him for a walk every morning in a baby walker, so that it knows there isn‚Äôt just one cat. There are of many kinds. Not to forget, hashu is also provided with different meals through an inlet whose doors are protected with lips, which goes further down to a sensor with a liquid called saliva which softens the food and then sensor records the taste. All of this is done to make sure that this Neural network knows there are flavors and tastes other than Cerelac too. Senior scientist, who also happens to be the grandmother of hashu, reveals in an exclusive interview that ‚ÄúIt was discovered from a warm place‚Äù, when was asked in a fury when I couldn‚Äôt stand why it is always wrapped with so many cloths. I proposed that I fear its actuators may jam and wrapping it in so many dresses may cause overheat failures. Senior scientist further cleared her point of view that ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt expose it directly to cold temperatures. It will take some time before it adapts the environment we live in‚Äù. Hashu‚Äôs eyes are also kinda sensitive and doesn‚Äôt open when exposed to sunlight. This Natural Neural Network is quite clever and has got familiar with its scientists and also knows their powers. For instance, once Dr. Sarosh was flying it around with his forearm by gripping it with his lower abdomen, in an online meeting. It wouldn‚Äôt just agree to stay still. It later got to full scale investigation where I inquired if that is really so, then how come Dr. Fatima fulfill his desires of flying it around. Dr. Sarosh replied confidently with an amused smile that hashu doesn‚Äôt ask the lady doctor for flying. He further added, "He has learned very quickly that crying can result in favorable results" The Simula Jefferson National Laboratory is excited and confident that this Neural Network that is being nurtured under their supervision will be a pride to their workplace family when its performance will be evaluated on a test dataset. The expected date is, when it manages to produce some meaningful noises through his vocal cords.

PM Imran Khan Facial Expression Recognition using Deep Learning ! Is the PM Khan telling us the truth about the Coronavirus? Let‚Äôs analyse  his facial‚Äô expressions during his recent speech on COVID'19 outbreak in Pakistan and Lockdown. In the initial stage i have trained CNN on Kaggle dataset The training set consists of 28,709 examples(up to 78% accuracy!) The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorise each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). I have also made a pie chart illustration on basis of his expressions which clearly states that (he seems sad and he is worried about the current situation) Hope everything gets better soon! PS: The video is in time elapse format.

Anyone here who has used NVIDIA DeepStream SDK or NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit? How can I develop an automated optical inspection  application with very good accuracy, given that I have sample images of defective and non-defective pieces. Question 1:  I know that DeepStream works with video feed but I am not sure whether it works with image input as well, because in production the conveyer belt will stop to take the picture. Answer: Yes it does. DeepStream supports  JPEG input streams.Question 2: Should I use the Transfer Learning toolkit to develop the model or build it from scratch?Question 3: The DeepStream sample apps  are in C language and Python bindings project is nascent. Has any one tried Python(or any other High Level Language) in production, because otherwise I have to use C language.If someone has already used these SDKs or worked on this kind of project, I want to discuss how should I approach this kind of problem.The  image I am attaching is an example of a defected piece because it is has a scratch at the top right corner.

Hi, I have few questions regarding Gradient Descent. While implementing linear regression in python using scikit learn, can we compute gradient descent or is it already implemented in scikit to minimize the cost function. In case if yes, then it means we dont have to do anything. 2. Can we use mean squared error for every model like classification, regression      etc. or is this specific to regression models.3. In case of object detection, what will be my cost function.4. Is gradient descent used for all ML algos minimize the cost functions. Can someone please confirm. Thank you.

Since the pixels values are mostly zero at the corners of each image, I cannot find the inverse, because the covariance matrix becomes a 'Singular Matrix' ie, the determinant is zero.

Mask Check üáµüá∞ / Computer Vision AI Lately, the whole world is struggling with fighting the outbreak of the coronavirus. As the disease is exceptionally easy to transmit, the best safety measure you can take is to limit contact with any publically used surface. Here, advanced technologies like computer vision. Purpose: To detect when someone is not wearing a mask or isn‚Äôt wearing their mask correctly.  Whether to wear a mask or not has been a vivid discussion in the past months. Some experts advise to wear, some undermine its effectiveness. There is only one conclusion ‚Äì wearing a mask can‚Äôt hurt. Most likely it helps to prevent COVID-19 from spreading or at least puts an extra obstacle. Mask Check uses Artificial  Network to recognize is a user is not wearing a mask. The API can be integrated to any existing or new IP cameras to detect people without a mask. App user can also add faces and phone numbers to send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. Future Upgrades? ‚Ä¢ Detect wether you are wearing the mask if you are then are you wearing it properly. ‚Ä¢ Its going to detect other symptoms as well like coughing, sneezing . ‚Ä¢ Body temperature ü§í  ‚Ä¢ Its going to label the mask , eg surgical mask , N95 mask etc. ‚Ä¢ Send you realtime alerts if you are lacking precautionary measures. ‚Ä¢ Inform the nearby health authorities incase of emergency or medical aid üÜò

Hi Seniors, I want your guidance If you could please help me answer some questions as I am a beginner and I have to make a project in which I have to detect objects of Office Inventory e.g. Keyboard, mouse, laptops etc. from real time video (mobile phone camera or any camera). I have done some research as which methods can detect objects. Following are my questions: 1) Can I use Faster RCNN and Yolo for my project 2) Are Faster RCNN and Yolo models already trained on some dataset 3) I have to generate my own data, my approach will be to make videos of office inventory and then take frames from those videos, augment the data and annotate them. Is this approach right. 4) In case above approach is correct then how can I annotate my image dataset as It will be huge dataset and using dark label or any other software will take a lot of time If I annotate every image manually. 5) How much image dataset should I have to train my model 6) To check the accuracy of my model, can I use mean average precision and intersection over union or are there any methods which I can use. Can I say mAP and IOU are my cost functions. Could you please be kind to guide me and clear my confusions and questions. Your guidance in this regard will be appreciated. Thank you.
