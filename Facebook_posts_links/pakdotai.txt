Here are some of points about #MachineLearning: 1. Machine Learning means learning from Data. 2. Machine = Your machine/computer Learning = Finding patterns from data 3. Machine Learning is just Data + Algorithms, but Data is more important. 4. Feature extraction is key. If total prediction power is 100% then the effort of feature engineering = 80% and the effort of the learning algorithm = 20%. 4. Overfitting is when your algorithm is memorizing instead of learning. 5. If you have small amounts of data then you‚Äôre better off using more simple models (linear&logistic regression). If you have large amounts of data you can try out more complex models (Deep Learning, etc.) 6. To avoid overfitting, always use regularization 7. Training is the most important part of Machine Learning.  8. Choose your features and hyper parameters carefully. 9. Machines don‚Äôt take decisions, people do. 10. Data cleaning is the most important part of Machine Learning. You know the saying: Garbage in Garbage out.

Are you working on an AI/ DS/ ML/ CV related project at your workplace, a research lab, or via freelance in Pakistan or abroad? (Focus is on Pakistan but your experience in companies abroad helps) If so, please volunteer for all or some of the following questions.  - What is your institution name? - Which domain in specific are you working on? Such as computer vision etc.  - What sort of questions does your company focus on at interviews? For instance some companies are known for heavy stats based questions for data analytics interviews from a book called Statistics with R. Would appreciate your depth in this. Others just focus on tools and no clear depth on concept. This question helps us in understanding the company.  - What language, tools are used at your institution if you are willing to answer.  - Does your company hire freshies (with some projects experience)?  - Does your company conduct a test? - What is the median salary at your workplace? You can choose to not answer this. - An insight if any, you would like to share for someone trying to enter this industry.  Edit: What are the one or two things your company looks for in a candidate in terms of experience? Atleast some software development background? Some self made projects? Their degrees? (I will be collecting these in a anon survey later on, with a few more questions and a form will be released. For now, share with us about your company! Will help me out in some questions by freshies)

"Health Care is one of the most important fields AI gonna transform"Sundar Pichai - CEO ALPHABETAs, I said last year in a post that I will be starting a series of projects for AI in health care to show and inspire developer community to develop AI for Good. Asia is lacking far behind in health care as compared to other developed countries. But now everyone has the power of changing that using AI. AI can be the best assistant of doctors in enormous cases, from helping them automate several scans and also giving best recommendations to patients. The scope of AI in health care is not just limited to doctors. It can also empower biologists and chemists to create more effective drugs or medicine based on specific type of disease. It can also lead us to try molecular level programming that will one day be a part of us saving us from different epidemics.I will be creating the projects series that will use Machine learning and Deep learning to find the best solution of different problems in health care. The project series will be open source and will be available on github. It has 2 parts:-1. Creation of models in python along with their weights .h5 file.2. Creation of Web API's and android applications from that models to show the world and get a business out of it.
