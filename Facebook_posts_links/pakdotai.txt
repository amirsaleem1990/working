Here are some of points about #MachineLearning: 1. Machine Learning means learning from Data. 2. Machine = Your machine/computer Learning = Finding patterns from data 3. Machine Learning is just Data + Algorithms, but Data is more important. 4. Feature extraction is key. If total prediction power is 100% then the effort of feature engineering = 80% and the effort of the learning algorithm = 20%. 4. Overfitting is when your algorithm is memorizing instead of learning. 5. If you have small amounts of data then you‚Äôre better off using more simple models (linear&logistic regression). If you have large amounts of data you can try out more complex models (Deep Learning, etc.) 6. To avoid overfitting, always use regularization 7. Training is the most important part of Machine Learning.  8. Choose your features and hyper parameters carefully. 9. Machines don‚Äôt take decisions, people do. 10. Data cleaning is the most important part of Machine Learning. You know the saying: Garbage in Garbage out.

Are you working on an AI/ DS/ ML/ CV related project at your workplace, a research lab, or via freelance in Pakistan or abroad? (Focus is on Pakistan but your experience in companies abroad helps) If so, please volunteer for all or some of the following questions.  - What is your institution name? - Which domain in specific are you working on? Such as computer vision etc.  - What sort of questions does your company focus on at interviews? For instance some companies are known for heavy stats based questions for data analytics interviews from a book called Statistics with R. Would appreciate your depth in this. Others just focus on tools and no clear depth on concept. This question helps us in understanding the company.  - What language, tools are used at your institution if you are willing to answer.  - Does your company hire freshies (with some projects experience)?  - Does your company conduct a test? - What is the median salary at your workplace? You can choose to not answer this. - An insight if any, you would like to share for someone trying to enter this industry.  Edit: What are the one or two things your company looks for in a candidate in terms of experience? Atleast some software development background? Some self made projects? Their degrees? (I will be collecting these in a anon survey later on, with a few more questions and a form will be released. For now, share with us about your company! Will help me out in some questions by freshies)

"Health Care is one of the most important fields AI gonna transform"Sundar Pichai - CEO ALPHABETAs, I said last year in a post that I will be starting a series of projects for AI in health care to show and inspire developer community to develop AI for Good. Asia is lacking far behind in health care as compared to other developed countries. But now everyone has the power of changing that using AI. AI can be the best assistant of doctors in enormous cases, from helping them automate several scans and also giving best recommendations to patients. The scope of AI in health care is not just limited to doctors. It can also empower biologists and chemists to create more effective drugs or medicine based on specific type of disease. It can also lead us to try molecular level programming that will one day be a part of us saving us from different epidemics.I will be creating the projects series that will use Machine learning and Deep learning to find the best solution of different problems in health care. The project series will be open source and will be available on github. It has 2 parts:-1. Creation of models in python along with their weights .h5 file.2. Creation of Web API's and android applications from that models to show the world and get a business out of it.

So much of the study I did assumed I had data. Well, now I don't and I can't seem to find a guide on how to label images like these so excuse this basic question.How do I label these cracks? Should I use lines or the brush tool? Do I tag them as cracks afterward? What I have seen done is that a different class of objects is made like kiwi and lemons. Do I make a class for cracks and road? Many thanks. *The end goal is segmentation.

Use this One Weird Trick to make your Python code blindingly fast: from numba import jit @jit def loops():         a = 0         for i in range(1000):                 for j in range(1000):                         for k in range(1000):                                 a += i * j * k         return a  print(loops()) What to watch for: 1. If there's a Numpy function that already does what you want, use that. 2. Numba covers most of native Python and Numpy functions, but not 100%. 3. jit-ted code is a bit trickier to debug, so save @jit for decorating your processing bottlenecks.

Had fun moderating a panel at GDG Kolachi's event yesterday- #ChaiAndAI over the state and future of AI Industry in Pakistan with the panelists who are some of the leading experts in this Industry. Hussain Mehmood from MarketLytics, Zia Saleem from Integration Experts, and Noman Khalid from LFD.  The conclusion of the panel talk: We identified a few challenges that the Industry faces i.e High demand of resources but less supply of quality resources, aversity to enter this Industry from potential clients, lack of proper data due to not a proper infrastructure etc. The panelists shared how they have gone above and beyond to fix the challenges above by training people for supply and demand side, by spending a decent amount of time with clients to help them not only believe how data centered processes can increase their efficiacy but also adjusting to their environments to deliver the solution the client wants.  A lot of different industries approach AI/ML companies just because their counterpart industries did something similar, without knowing why they need it. But the AI/Ml companies bear a huge responsibility educating such industries and helping them derive a solution that offers efficiency above cost- and sales matter. One crucial advice for people aspiring to enter this fiend was "Do not enter this field just because you think its the end of the world if you dont study anything AI/ ML related- do it because you like it." If you are that keen on learning, still identify your passion first- it could be psychology, marketing anything and then figure out how you can apply AI in this domain. Yes this field has been around for a long time but innovations has been more lately. As Zia Saleem quoted, "If you were interested in data science a few years back, you probably would have been doing a BBA," and Noman Khalid said, "Do a BBA" :P and yes finish what you have started, don't jump here and there- begin and finish. There are different learning tracks leading you to the same thing often, but pick one and go through entirely. Be consistent. And yes, as we say again and again and again- "YOU CANNOT BECOME A DATA SCIENTIST IN ONE MONTH, NOT EVEN IF UDACITY CLAIMS IT." Overall, we have some great people in the Industry trying to equip the generation for the 4th Industrial wave. There are challenges, it will take time, but these people understand the ins and out and are working tirelessly and will full believe to make things happen. There was a lot more to learn. If anybody else attended, please do quote. Lastly, there were still a lot of people confused between AI, ML, DS and the differences between all- if you are confused please take a lot at our announcements at the 'Pakistan.AI Bank'. We have maintained all this on our Github.  This last year I tried to focus on professional growth (as you know, I am a software engineer at Systems) but oh how much have I missed community work!!!!

Questions for the people from academia/research labs, if you know anyone who can helpful here please tag them. Would be preferred if people from pure research side answer this. There have been some work in R&D products in labs but my questions are not posed towards them. - What is the current of state of research in your institution/lab? What sub-fields of AI is your group focused on? What sort of problem are you currently working on? - What is the total size of your research group/team? And how many journal/conference papers your group has published? - Is your research group in collaboration with a foreign research institute/group? If yes, please mention the groups. - What sort of full time research opportunities are available there in your group for non faculty, non student aspiring researchers? - If someone who's currently in industry with around a couple of years expirience or someone who's doing research in a different area and wants to move into AI research, what opportunities are there for them? - What would be the average pay for a full-time researcher in your group, given they've done Bachelor's degree with some research exposure in FYP? If you prefer not to answer any of the above questions, just skip them, give as much info as you comfortably can. Thank you.

High accuracy pedestrian detection based on #RPN and #synthetic #dataset. The most exciting feature in RPN is anchor boxes. I used K-means clustering for anchor boxes generation because If the size of Anchor boxes is selected well, then it will be easier for the network to learn. The red dots in the anchor box position are positive samples (area of interest) and the black dots are negative samples that all belongs to background.
