Hi, guys. Traffic congestion is a burning issue in most countries due to the rapid growth of running vehicles and infrastructures with limited capacity. Congestion can be solved with Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and traffic management. Most traffic management measures are aimed to improve the safety and flow of traffic, reduce traffic emissions and utilize traffic artery capacity more effectively. So here we go: Road Traffic App Tutorial
