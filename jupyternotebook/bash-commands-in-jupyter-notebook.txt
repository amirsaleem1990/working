we can run shell commands from jupyternotebook in various ways.
1- !
eg: !ls *.txt -1

2- os.system()
eg: os.system("!ls *.txt -1")

3- %%bash
type %%bash on the top of cell, and type your bash commands as you type on terminal.

if you need to capture an output:

%%bash --out your_variable_name
pip3 list
# now output of <pip3 list> is stored in your_variable_name as str, you can use it in your python code.
